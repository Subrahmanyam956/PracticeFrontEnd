                <h2>The IRON MAN of INDIA</h2>
                <p>
                    <B>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</B>was born in Nadiad, Kheda district and raised in the countryside of the state of Gujarat.
                    He was a successful lawyer. One of Mahatma Gandhi's earliest political lieutenants, he organised peasants from Kheda, 
                    Borsad and Bardoli in Gujarat in non-violent civil disobedience against the British Raj, becoming one of the 
                    most influential leaders in Gujarat. He was appointed as the 49th President of Indian National Congress. 
                    Under the chairmanship of Patel "Fundamental Rights and Economic Policy" resolution was passed by the Congress. 
                    Patel's position at the highest level in the Congress was largely connected with his role from 1934 onwards 
                    (when the Congress abandoned its boycott of elections) in the party organisation. Based at an apartment in Bombay, 
                    he became the Congress's main fundraiser and chairman of its Central Parliamentary Board, playing the leading role 
                    in selecting and financing candidates for the 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly in New Delhi 
                    and for the provincial elections of 1936. While promoting the Quit India Movement. Patel made a climactic speech 
                    to more than 100,000 people gathered at Gowalia Tank in Bombay on 7 August 1942. Historians believe that Patel's speech 
                    was instrumental in electrifying nationalists, who up to then had been sceptical of the proposed rebellion. 
                    Patel's organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India.
